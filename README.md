# PixelArtMaker

Description - This is the Final Project for the Intro to Programming Nano-Degree from Udacity. 
It includes HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The premise is that the user will be able to create a grid and color each cell in the grid by
selecting a color and clicking on the cell. Hitting the Submit button again after it has been colored will clear the canvas.
